**S – Situation:**  
As part of my career development activities, I completed a personality assessment through an online course on blackboard.

The goal was to better understand my personality traits and how they influence my career choices, communication style and teamwork.

**A – Action:**  
I answered a series of questions about how I think, behave and react in different situations. The test gave me a detailed summary of my personality type, strengths, weaknesses and work preferences.

**R – Result:**  
The assessment showed that I am organized, logical thinker and problem solver. It helped me see why certain roles or environments suit me better than others. I now have a clearer idea of what kinds of jobs I’ll enjoy and do well in.
